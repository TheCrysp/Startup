## Startup Company: What Is It?

Startups are young companies founded to develop a unique product or service, bring it to market and make it irresistible and irreplaceable for customers.

Startups are rooted in innovation, addressing the deficiencies of existing products or creating entirely new categories of goods and services, thereby disrupting entrenched ways of thinking and doing business for entire industries. That’s why many startups are known within their respective industries as “disruptor.”



## Why Startup?

A startup is something that makes our world better everyday because it provides new jobs, innovations, changes, and connections between different people. You should pursue a startup if it’s something that you are most passionate about. It’s a thrill and exciting experience. You will face countless challenges, obstacles, and failures. However, if you want to make your startup successful, I need you to focus on working hard everyday and do everything you need to do.

"I strongly believe all students should have a Startup During College. Doesn't matter if successful or how big or small. Worst case scenario it will make them "10x better employee than someone with no exposure to how a business works." - Kunal Shah
